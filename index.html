            For the past three years, the vibrant city of Manila has been my home. My roots, however, are firmly planted in Samar, where I spent my formative years. For my tertiary education, I entered an IT Training Program in Cebu which helped me build fundamental skills to be employed in IT-BPO Industry. I recently discovered that Bohol has a special place in my heart and I spend some time there when my work arrangement permits. Since I've been jumping from one place to another for a few years now, I look forward to living a couple of years in Davao (possibly on remote work) which would mean I would have lived to 3 major groups of islands in the Philippines - Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

            On weekends, I love to hangout and go to a Catholic Church in New Manila and go 'kiddie' biking around BJesse (BGC) and Ayala in Taguig and Makati. I may not be gifted with great talents and intellect but I enjoy reading in public libraries and visiting museums in Manila and Quezon City. Honestly, I find it hard to join communities while I work on night shift. Most of the time, I keep myself busy at home or visit my parents who live about an-hour drive.

            While my current residence has a strict “no pets” policy, it doesn’t stop me from showing some love to our furry friends. I have taken on the role of the unofficial neighborhood cat feeder and dog whisperer. When the dogs get a bit too rowdy and their barks threaten to disrupt my calls, I step in to restore peace and quiet.
